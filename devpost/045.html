					Anundo has been remastered as a concealed village, nestled somewhere within the expansive continent of Aeven. The primary intention was to restore the village on its approximate original location. To honor its authentic hidden nature, Anundo continues to remain concealed, guarded by Carnivos, and accessible only through the original labyrinthine stair puzzle. Its concealed nature has been enhanced by placing the village on higher grounds, encircled with cascading mountain walls and waterfalls. Naturally, the ninja leader is back and housed within his chamber. The new high grounds also seemed a fitting place to rehouse the butterflies, along with additional gathering spots.

After careful consideration, the most fitting location resembling the spot chosen at Greenlake, next to the Anundo elevator. To enhance the sense of peril and darkness surrounding the Death Cave, a decision was made to divide the cave system into two layers, creating both a passive and aggressive semi-end level training area. The Reaper remains concealed within the darkest, most corrupted recesses of this death cave.

					Despair Island, also referred to as the Enchanted Forest or the Birdman Forest, has always had this special maze vibe. Due to its different (small) puzzle map sizes, a choice was made to separate this world from the main continent, accessible by Sealiner <b>104</b>. Presently, there is just a single side-quest to embark upon. Once the debuff/buff systems are developed the longterm goal is to bestow the Hermit with a substantial buff blessing. Making it more worthwhile to re-visit him once in a while.

					It's clear that new players require a certain starting point to bridge the gap in levels and stats, the choice to create a guided and exp-boosted linear progression towards the endgame is probably the only and most common used solution in MMOS's. 
					Additional main and side quests have been added into the game, and there is an ongoing effort to introduce more quests on top of this to enhance the diversity and enjoyment of this linear part.

					The level cap, that is unavoidabkle with linear progress, is probably making everyone unhappy and gives players, even below the level cap, the unnecessary feeling of a limitation. From the development perspective things are even worse! This way of development consumes a substantial amount of development time in creating sufficient maps to accommodate the slightly higher leveled NPCs to sustain the level cap cycle. To develop the game up to high levels, in this manner, will likely maintain this situation up to the next year. Another significant drawback is that the extensive development efforts invested in areas from Level 0 to 80 become unattractive for Level 100+ players who have no reason to revisit those regions.

					The decision has been made to set Level 30 as the starting point for the semi-endgame phase, primarily to prevent the development of an excess of linear content that loses its significance over time. The plan revolves around introducing elements such as future item upgrade progressions, <b>private</b> dungeons maps, and engaging daily and weekly activities. Importantly, players will retain the option to continue leveling indefinitely. Most MMOs hit players with an exp wall (x50million tnl) at the endgame level (usually around 50) So keeping the level grind going is an unique oppertunity.

					<br/><br/>

					One idea is to implement a scaling system for the <b>public</b> training maps above Level 30, dynamically adjusting the difficulty level based on the player's level or the level of the first NPC encountered. This approach ensures that both lower and higher-level players can interact within public training zones, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic and re-playable gaming environment.

					<br/><br/>

					As of now, NPCs have been configured with a passive level of 30 and an aggressive level of 35. However, the final decision regarding the above, has still to be made. Ideas are always welcome.
