<a name="27Nov03"></a><h3>27th November 2003 - development update</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"A lot of time have been spend to deal with all known bugs, so we can say 'byebye' to them for good. It looks like the 0.04 client has become a stable, non-problem software product for everyone. A lot of new gfx have been added and will be added for the next comming weeks. Minor server problems also been worked out. 
<br />
Expect a real-time 'who is online player list' on the website soon, the auto mysql and php script generator is almost finished, this software will allow server-owners to easy setup and secure the database and php scripts with just a few mouse clicks. 
<br />
A dynamic 'linked' map file format is being researched to reduce a full 255x255 map to only 70 or 80kb, this should be possible with a linked-list and some file compression.. When done the way is clear for the visual offline mapeditor, people (mappers) will be able to easy build and link isometric maps!! :) 
<br />
As usuall this development stage will take a while, we are building a game but also the whole game and server engine from scratch :P"
</p>
<a name="28Nov03"></a><h3>28th November 2003 - website intergration</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"An experimental real-time 'online player list' is now available, click here to see it in action. Still working on the automatic php generators to make everything as smooth as possible. Also more scripts will be available in time, like top50 players, player character sheets and real-time server status."
</p>
<a name="29Nov03"></a><h3>29th November 2003 - Website upgrade</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">

The server is still down because of unknown reasons. The current problems are not the result of a malfunction in my server sourcecode or the database. The server suddenly stopped working and never came back online since that moment. Also this hosting company and its datacentre are still not responding my questions so the reason is still unknown im affraid.
<br />
If you see the 'could not find server' message its because our server is down and not because there is something wrong with your own computer, more info follows once i know more."

"EndlessOnline has been mistreated by a certain hosting 'companies'. Aengie and Vult-r are at risk of losing almost $800. EndlessOnline is a free game, with no advertisements or donations, this loss of funds will have a deep inpact on all players. 
<br />
The current gameserver has already been re-formatted by a heartless datacentre without any notice, we have some backups but ofcourse there will be data-loss 
<br />
We are struggled in some debate with the datacentre and the hosting company but so far it doesnt seem we will ever be refunded. Even though we only request half our money back to setup a temporary server and stop Endless from bleeding. 
<br />
Its just sad that certain people mistreated a totally free game, developed by people with a certain dream... They really not care how much they have hurt us and all players who believed in Endless. 
<br />
We are in a final and critical fase of claiming a refund, if this fails we will publish the whole story including names of all responsible for this tragidy, because we think all players deserve a explaination.

Keep the faith, vult-r and aengie."

<a name="7May06"></a><h3>7th May 2006 - Webstats temporary disabled</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"With a new database thread running on the gameserver we reached over 900 players online. To keep it running so smooth the webstats need some recoding as well. As soon as its done the stats will be showing up to date stats again."
</p>
<a name="20May06"></a><h3>20th May 2006 - Database threading</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"I have been working quite hard lately on recoding the Endless server code. My idea was to remove all database i/o operations from the game logic loop and place them in their own execution thread. This could reduce the lag that we experience with 800+ connections. I was a bit nervous to run the first binairies on the test server, after all i putted many days work into this new code, and it would be a big waste to see it crash. At this moment the test server has been running for 12 hours quite steady. Thats not bad considering that this is the first test run. Its a big relieve that everything seems to be ok. Lets hope the new code is really going to improve most of the lag issues. I will probably find out in a few days when i launch the new server on the 800+ main server."

<p style="font-style:italic;">
"After applying a very small update on the gameserver the whole thing failed on me. And soon i was caught up in a situation with hunderds of errors, and evil server crashes. After many reboots and blind fixes it suddenly became stable again.. This kind of things are really causing me a headache. Maybe there is a problem with the server RAM or something, but its not worth looking into, because there will be a new server anyway."

<p style="font-style:italic;">
"Most of you probably noticed some guy sausage managed to hack into the Endless Online forum. I never really maintained the phpbb script, because i lacked the time to upgrade the countless versions of phpbb. It took me a full week of porting over the layout, database and other stuff. This week I been rather busy working on a problem in some realtime video/audio intercom-software (something i do for my job), so I feared it would take me a while to recover the forums, but it only took a week :P Now that the forums are fixed I can continue coding on the quest/script engine for EO. Its already loading and parsing the script files. I am planning to support some basic events and actions for it first, and experiment with that in a new version of Endless Online."

<a name="15Dec06"></a><h3>15th December 2006 - New Endless Online</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"After weeks of working it looks like another version of Endless Online is ready to go public. Unfortunatly we came to the conclusion that re-balancing the total world was a step to far. Instead we semi-balanced the world to something acceptable. In fact i just wrote a script that auto calculated all the stats of the npcs/items etc… We probably start to re-design the items + maps for the next version, which may take us a while. I thought the best thing to do is just enable all new features and release what we got so far. This way the waiting is a litle shorter and meanwhile all new features will get throughly tested. The new battle system looks promising, cant wait to see it fully come into action when everything is in balance. For v0.27 its important to buy all accessable items such as BELT, NECKLAGES, RINGS to get strong enough to fight the npcs in your range. Some items such as twinblade and other rare drops have a little extra stats, to keep things fair."

Instead of balancing the whole world, we just released this version semi-balanced. This way we avoid the long wait on a newer verson, and also all new features are fully tested while we can continue balancing all the items :)

The new client is needed to continue playing, you can download the latest client here."

<a name="Hacked"></a><h3>July 2015 - BUYVM.NET aka frantech gave away the server.</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"The server was compromised. By hackers? no: Basically the hosting company BUYVM.NET gave the account and server to a complete stranger claiming it with a GMAIL account. How silly is that? :) EO database was destroyed, and EO probably will be down for a while, you can contact this idiot here: cboas@frantech.ca"

<h3>Auguest 2015 - To the community</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
"Please change your password for other online services in case you are using the same password as you did in Endless Online. As you all know the database of this game (and all passwords inside) were compromised. It's still unbelievable for me knowing that this critical access was just handed over by BUYVM.NET to people with bad intentions. EO will be down for now."
